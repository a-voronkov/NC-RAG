**Date:** 2025-01-19  
**Repository:** https://github.com/a-voronkov/NC-RAG  
**Server:** ncrag.voronkov.club  

## ✅ Completed Development

### Phase 1: Base System ✅
- Nextcloud + PostgreSQL deployed and running
- Admin user created, file operations working
- Persistent volumes configured

### Phase 2: Webhooks ✅  
- WebhookListeners app enabled
- Node-RED webhook endpoint configured
- Event normalization and logging implemented

### Phase 3: Queue Layer ✅
- RabbitMQ service with management UI
- Queue infrastructure (events.files, ingest.ready)
- Node-RED AMQP integration
- HTTPS fronting with Traefik

### Phase 4: Go Worker ✅
- Complete Go microservice implementation
- RabbitMQ consumer with concurrent workers
- Nextcloud WebDAV client for file fetching
- Parser API client with job submission
- Redis storage for job state management
- Mock parser service for testing
- Docker integration with multi-stage build

## 🔍 Server Status (Verified)

| Service | Status | HTTP Code | Deployment Status |
|---------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Nextcloud | ✅ Running | 302 | Phase 1 deployed |
| RabbitMQ Management | ✅ Available | 401 | Phase 3 partially deployed |
| Node-RED Webhook | ❌ Not accessible | 404 | Phase 2/3 needs deployment |
| Parser Endpoint | ❌ Not accessible | 502 | Phase 4 needs deployment |

## 📋 Ready for Deployment

### Phase 3 Components
- ✅ RabbitMQ service (appears configured)
- ❌ Node-RED with AMQP integration
- ❌ Updated webhook routing

### Phase 4 Components  
- ❌ Go Worker service
- ❌ Redis for job state management
- ❌ Mock parser service

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Manual Deployment (SSH Required)
```bash
# 1. SSH to server
ssh root@ncrag.voronkov.club

# 2. Navigate to project
cd /srv/docker/nc-rag

# 3. Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# 4. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with production values:
# - NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_PASSWORD (current password)
# - RABBITMQ_APP_PASS (secure password)  
# - PARSER_SECRET (secure secret)

# 5. Deploy services
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --build

# 6. Verify deployment
docker compose ps
./scripts/test-phase4.sh
```

### Expected Results After Deployment
- Node-RED webhook: `200` response
- Parser endpoint: `200/201` response  
- RabbitMQ queues: events.files, ingest.ready visible
- Redis: responding to commands
- Worker: processing file events

## 🧪 Testing Available

### Automated Tests
- `./scripts/test-current-status.sh` - Check server status
- `./scripts/test-phase3.sh` - Test RabbitMQ integration
- `./scripts/test-phase4.sh` - Test full pipeline

### Manual Verification
- Upload file to Nextcloud → should trigger processing
- Check RabbitMQ queues for messages
- Monitor Worker logs for activity
- Verify job state in Redis

## 📊 Architecture Overview

```
Nextcloud (✅ Running)
    ↓ WebhookListeners
Node-RED (❌ Needs deployment)
    ↓ AMQP publish  
RabbitMQ (✅ Partially deployed)
    ↓ Consumer
Go Worker (❌ Needs deployment)
    ├─ Fetch: Nextcloud WebDAV
    ├─ Submit: Parser API
    └─ Store: Redis (❌ Needs deployment)
         ↓
Mock Parser (❌ Needs deployment)
```

## 🎯 Next Actions

1. **Deploy Phase 3/4** - SSH to server and run deployment commands
2. **Test Integration** - Verify end-to-end file processing
3. **Validate Gates** - Confirm Phase 3 and 4 criteria met
4. **Begin Phase 5** - Parser completion handling (polling + webhook)

## 📁 Key Files

- `docker-compose.yml` - Complete service configuration
- `.env.example` - Environment variables template
- `services/worker/` - Go Worker implementation
- `services/mock-parser/` - Testing parser service
- `scripts/test-*.sh` - Testing and validation scripts

**Status:** Ready for server deployment and integration testing
