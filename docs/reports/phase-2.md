# Phase 2 Report

- Owner: agent
- Dates: start → 2025-08-21
- Traces: N/A

## Checklist Status

- Do:
  - Register HTTPS endpoint(s): POST `/webhooks/nextcloud` — implemented
  - In Node-RED, parse payload → normalize JSON — implemented
  - Enable WebhookListeners in Nextcloud — pending
- What NOT to do:
  - Don’t process files inside Node-RED — respected
  - Don’t expose Node-RED editor publicly — respected (only webhook path routed)
  - Don’t leave webhook delivery on 5-min cron — pending
- Verify:
  - Simulate upload/delete/share; see Node-RED receive events quickly — pending
- Gate:
  - All required event types are received and logged within ~60s — pending

## Steps

1. Added secret validation to Node-RED flow (`X-Webhook-Secret` header)
2. Normalized events written to `/data/webhook-log.jsonl`
3. Wired `WEBHOOK_SECRET` env into `docker-compose.yml`

## Next Actions

- Enable and configure Nextcloud WebhookListeners/Flow to call the endpoint
- Add RabbitMQ and queue wiring in Phase 3
- Add headless checks for webhook delivery

## Evidence

- Flow file: `services/node-red/flows.json`
- Compose env: `WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- Log file: `/data/webhook-log.jsonl`
